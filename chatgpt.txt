General guidelines to consider in Python implementations:
1. Use logging instead of print statements.
2. Prepare requirements.txt file

Implement a daemon process for Mysql 8 backup using Python.
Daemon process should have 2 independent scheduled jobs.
  1. Takes full mysql full backups in each 24 hours.
  2. Takes incremental mysql backups in each 5 minutes. Incremental backup should use the latest full backup.

Additional features:
1. Record duration of each backup operation.
2. Backups are uploaded to S3
3. The application should be configurable. Use a config file to fetch the parameters. No need to fetch S3 access key and S3 security key.
5. Only backup files which belong to last 14 days should be kept. Older files should be deleted. The duration of backup files to be kept should be configurable.
6. Prepare .service file. Script will be installed under /opt/cobackup. The script will be executed by 'ec2-user'

A utility script to recover from a backup is also required.
The utility script should support:
1. Recovery from a full backup
2. Recovery from an incremental backup.
3. Once the script is executed, the script should available backups and let the user select which backup to recover from. The list of available backups should be fetched from S3.
4. Use the same config file with backup.py.

And lastly, implement an installation script using bash.
The script should support:
1. downloads the bundle from https://amazon.com/cobackup.zip
2. unzips the file under /opt/cobackup
3. asks for configuration parameters and saves answers to config file
4. updates systemctl using .service file
5. Also provide command line parameters for each of the config parameters.
